# cra-template-github-my-profile

 - What the idea :
The idea was to create a progressive multilingual (multi-platform) web application displaying all the information necessary for a global and rapid vision of your Github account and to make it easily customizable for all developers, juniors and / or job seekers.
Possibly, this so that he can highlight their profile in front of potential employers and, therefore, increase the number of visitors to their github page.


***Github My Profile PWA (V2.0.0)***

- What is it :

This is the GithubMyProfile app template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is an open source multilingual (fr - en - pt) app licensed under the Creative Commons license.

Being a PWA, it is installable under most operating systems as well as under android (Tested myself).

 You can now have a quick view of your Github account information, such as:

- Your personal stats in real time among other statistics of the most used languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the platform.

- There is an "About" page and a footer that you can fully customize with your images, links, pdf, etc ...

- Also, there is a list of 50 of your "created by you" and 50 "forked" repositories.

To use this template when creating a new app it's really easy.
