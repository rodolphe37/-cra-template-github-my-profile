# cra-template-github-my-profile

This is the official Github My Profile app template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To use this template when creating a new app it's really easy.

**here's how:**

Put your app name in this line, at  ``` <YOUR NAME HERE> ``` and that's all!

```sh

# One ligne code (big, but one line only anyway)
mkdir packages && cd packages && git clone https://github.com/rodolphe37/cra-template-github-my-profile.git && cd .. && npx create-react-app <YOUR APP NAME HERE> --template file:./packages/cra-template-github-my-profile && rm -rf packages

```
after that, go to the "How to personnalise yours application GithubMyProfile
